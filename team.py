            Justification:

            Both best and worst case complexities are O(P) for the init function. Most of the operations
            in the init function are performed in constant time, except the part where the initial players are 
            added into the Array of Linked Lists. We do this by calling the add_player() method which takes O(1)
            time in both best and worst case. However, since we are meant to store all the player it takes O(P) * O(1)
            time, simplfying the best and worst case complexity for the function to O(P), where P is the number of initial players.

            Best Case:
            The best case occurs when the player that is to be removed from the team is in the head of the LinkedList- so finding the index and deleting the 
            player all happens in constant time, along with player deletion from hash table which costs O(1)- resulting in an O(1) best case time complexity.

            Worst Case:
